# TSP

**Project - Formal Languages and Automata Theory**

Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is an NP-complete problem and currently we do not have a  fast  algorithm  for  its  solution,  known  algorithms  are  exponential. 

The aim of this project is to find the most optimal solution for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and in the most reasonable time using heuristic algorithms. Heuristic algorithms do not guarantee to return the optimal solution; however, they return good enough solutions in a reasonable time. 

The specific TSP problem you willattempt to solvecontains **4,663 Cities in Canada**. The XY coordinates of the cities are given in the attachment. Thefigure below shows these citiesin the XY-plane.**The shortest tour length is 1,290,319 and it is shown visually below.**

```
The heuristic algorithms: 
1. Nearest Neighbor Algorithm 
2. Greedy Algorithm
3. Divide and Conquer Strategy
```
